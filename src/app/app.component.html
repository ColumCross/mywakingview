  <p>When I was in England I saw an art exhibit where a guy stamped and mailed a postcard with the time he woke up everyday. So, taking inspiration from that, and a couple of other things, for a full year I took a picture of what I saw out my window when I woke up, with the date, time, and location.</p>
